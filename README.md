# Animated-Solar-System2￼!   
SOME Additions:!
! 1) SpaceShip - spaceship near the sun. The spaceship also implements IRenderable. There is also a model of a spaceship by it self, press “m” in order to change models. We also made the spaceship move just like the planets, the spaceship moves around the sun.!
!
! 2) Asteroids - The Asteroid also implements IRenderable. 2 asteroids are randomized and added to the solar system, when you move with the mouse or you zoom in or out you see  
them moving, the asteroids also have textures. there texture is a brown texture.!
￼
￼! 3) Asteroids on orbit - We added another 2 asteroids besides the 2 we had already mentioned and they are moving around an orbit and also have a texture.!
!
!
! 4) Background- We added a background texture. !
!
Required instructions:!
 
1) We draw all the planets repented by a sphere, each one is located on an orbit of itself. each one is moving, each one has it’s texture according to the textures we got. also the moon is moving around earth. 
￼
￼ 
2) Planets sizes and distances from the sun - as you wrote on the instruction we should not use the real proportions but we tried to make the plants sizes and distances proportions as good as possible using log of there original size. 
 
3) We made a general axis and an axis for each of the planets, when you press “a” on the keyboard both of the axis, the general one and those of each planet disappear or the opposite. !
 
4) Each of the the other instructions work also “l” for the light spheres to disappear “m” to change model “p” for polygon mode and the zoom in, zoom out, and moving with the mouse. “c” and “s” for the camera views also we added a camera view near the spaceship to see the
spaceship moving. We Used the MVC design pattern.
